Configuration files and installation guide for the RT6 car radio-display for Citroen &amp; Peugeot using MiraScripts.

## My experince 
This guid comes from my tries and experiments with my car (Citroen C4 phase 2), that has an RT6 autoradio. The problem was that from time to time the autoradio freezes and i had to reboot it with the CD eject button (long press till it turns off), so as a starter i tried to update its firmware from 2.70 to 2.86 (the latest as far as i know). I did not succes in doing that as the RT6 has an internal micro SD card which was super slow (hence the freezing problem). 

Second try, i bought a new micro SD card (8GB) and got RT6 firmware version 2.86, i ended up with the instalation starting but never finishing, after lot and lot of tries that requires formating the sd card, it was damaged, and i found that from forums that sometimes going to a way higher version of the firmware won't work. 

Third try, another mirco sd card (16 GB) in order to install the firmware (now version 2.75) and the maps. finally, instalation worked, but i ended up with Peugeot boot screen and radio keybord buttons not working (assume they were reconfigured for Peugeot cars).

Now time to configure those things, and i found somthing called [MiraScripts]http://mira308sw.altervista.org/fr/index.htm), where i used RT6_MiraScripts and DatExplorer to configure the RT6 for my car and to enable extra feautres in it.
